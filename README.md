Task 4: Modern Calculator App Completed! 🎉

Excited to share the completion of my latest project: a sleek Calculator App with added functionality for Notes and Calculation History! 
This project showcases a clean UI and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here’s a breakdown of the features: 
✔️ A fully functional calculator with basic operators, percentage, and clear/delete options. 
✔️ Calculation history that logs past operations for easy reference. 
✔️ A notes section where users can add and keep track of important thoughts or details. 
✔️ Smooth user experience with real-time display updates and error handling.

This was a great task to combine multiple elements of user interaction into one interface. The next step is to improve the app with additional features or mobile responsiveness!

Task 3 is completed. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
